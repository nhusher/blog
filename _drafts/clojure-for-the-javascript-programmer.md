In [my last post], I covered the termination of YUI project at a high level. At some point, I might write about the details of what made YUI special, but not now. Now, I want to write about what I've enjoyed the most in the last year. I want to write about Clojure.

About a year ago, I started digging into Clojure; I was working in an environment where some Clojure tooling existed, and I wanted to be able to contribute. A couple of my teammates were enthusiasts for the language, and were eager to explain the value proposition offered by the language. Serendipitous to that, David Nolen wrote a piece titled "[The Future of Javascript MVC Frameworks](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/)," where he introduced *Om*, a high-performing view layer for web apps written in ClojureScript (the compile-to-ms flavor of Clojure).

Learning a new programming language and environment is a bit like throwing yourself into a pit, then climbing your way back out. The bottom of the pit is where you're surrounded by uncertainty and disorientation. You're right up close to concepts that you don't fully understand, and it's difficult to see their shape. There's a light somewhere above you, cast by the promise of people solving real problems in this unfamiliar universe.

The depth of this pit, and the slope of the sides, is measured by the unfamiliarity of the language. For example, it's pretty easy to migrate from Java to C#; they're both third-generation object-oriented languages with overlapping concepts. Once you get over the minor differences in syntax, idioms, and standard libraries, you can probably start contributing to projects in some capacity.

Clojure was a different beast, at least for me. It's really different from what I was used to, and it requires a working knowledge of a few unfamiliar concepts all at once.

I found myself at the bottom of a very deep well with only a few tools to work my way out; most of those tools came from javascript.

Arriving at a level of competency with Clojure is *a lot* like writing really clean, terse, hygienic javascript. It doesn't look the same at all, but the concepts rhyme a lot.
