In [my last post], I covered the termination of YUI project at a high level and why I thought that was a bad thing. At some point, I might write about the details of what made YUI special, but not now. Now, I want to write about what I've enjoyed the most in the last year. I want to write about Clojure.

About a year ago, I started digging into Clojure. I was working on a product where some of the tooling was written in Clojure, and I wanted to be able to contribute. A couple of my teammates were enthusiasts for the language, and were eager to explain the value proposition offered by it. Serendipitous to that, David Nolen wrote a piece titled "[The Future of Javascript MVC Frameworks](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/)," where he introduced *Om*, a high-performing view layer for web apps written in ClojureScript (the compile-to-JS flavor of Clojure).

Learning a new programming language and environment is a bit like throwing yourself into a pit, then climbing your way back out. The bottom of the pit is where you're surrounded by uncertainty and disorientation caused by being up-close to concepts that you don't fully understand. There's a light somewhere above you, cast by the promise of people solving real problems in this unfamiliar universe.

The depth of this pit &mdash; and the slope of the sides &mdash; is measured by the unfamiliarity of the language. It's pretty easy to migrate from Java to C#; they're both third-generation object-oriented languages with greatly-overlapping concepts. Once you get over the minor differences in syntax, idioms, and standard libraries, it's easy to contribute to projects in some capacity.

Clojure was a different beast, at least for me. It's really different from what I was used to, and it requires a working knowledge of a few unfamiliar concepts all at once.

I found myself at the bottom of a very deep well with only a few tools to work my way out; most of those tools came from javascript.

Arriving at a level of competency with Clojure is *a lot* like writing really clean, terse, hygienic javascript. It doesn't look the same at all, but the concepts rhyme a lot.
