In [my last post][1], I covered the termination of YUI project at a high level and why I thought that was a bad thing. At some point, I might write about the details of what made YUI special, but not now. Now, I want to write about what I've enjoyed the most in the last year. I want to write about Clojure.

Learning a new programming language is a bit like throwing yourself into a pit, then climbing your way back out. At the bottom of the pit, you're up-close to concepts that you don't fully understand, and sometimes it's difficult to see the value offered by them. It's disorienting and insecure at the bottom. There's a light somewhere above you, cast by the promise of people solving real problems in this unfamiliar universe.

The depth of this pit&mdash;and the slope of the sides&mdash;is measured by the unfamiliarity of the language. For example, it's pretty easy to migrate from Java to C#; they're both third-generation object-oriented languages with very similar styles. Once you get over the minor differences in syntax, language idioms, and standard libraries, it's easy to contribute to projects in some capacity.

Programming languages also aren't just a collection of syntax to memorize, they also encode a set of ideas about how to write a program. We tend to not think about that, because most languages we encounter contain broadly similar ideas, and our understanding of concepts shifts fairly slowly. It took 20 years for concepts in early object-oriented languages (ALGOL, Simula) to make it into mainstream languages. It took 40 years for functions to become first-class values in most languages.

Clojure is a new

For most people, me included, Clojure is a different beast. It has an unfamiliar syntax, which is bad enough, but it also wraps a bunch of alien concepts in a way to make it feel very unapproachable. I found myself at the bottom of a very deep well with only a few tools to work my way out. Most of those tools, most of those tools came from javascript. I found that building a basic competency with Clojure is *a lot* like writing really clean, terse, hygienic javascript.

It doesn't *look* the same at all, but it does seem rhyme a lot.



 Clojure isn't just another programming language, it's a language that has a bunch of really interesting ideas encoded in it, ideas that I'm convinced have made me a better programmer.

First, Clojure is a flavor of lisp. I think it's mandatory for CS programs to expose students to functional programming at some point, but instead of lisp I was forced to learn OCaml.

OCaml is a a really interesting language in its own right.
