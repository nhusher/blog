> Developers that are used to the incumbent look and feel of Angular are in {for a} few surprises. As InfoQ’s David Iffland comments, the framework will be “drastically different looking”, meaning users will need to get to grips with a new kind of architecture. It’s also been confirmed that there will be no migration path from Angular 1.X to 2.0.

It really does look like a *new* framework, rather than an incremental improvement over Angular 1.x. Also, Angular 1.x [is going into maintenance mode][2]:

> One thing that is changing, however, is our support for new features and breaking changes in Angular 1.x. With a few exceptions, these will be deferred to 2.0, and will be better addressed with the new design. We'll still be reviewing PRs and responding to issues but our focus with 1.x will be on stability, security, performance, rather than features.

Once 2.0 is released, the support timeline for 1.x bugfixes [is only going to be 2 years][3]. To me, it doesn't make sense to be writing a lot of new Angular code for a while. But at least the new framework is going to be awesome, right?

> According to AngularJS founder Miško Hevery, the goal of Angular 2.0 is to completely overhaul the development experience. One means of doing this is Google’s new programming language AtScript, which can be employed for developing Angular applications.

To steal a John Gruberism, [good luck with that][4].
