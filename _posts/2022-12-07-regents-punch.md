For the last few years I've been tasked with bringing a big batched cocktail to holiday family gatherings. I've brought a few different things over the years, but the last two years I've settled on this modified [Regent's Punch][regents-punch] as an ideal pre-dinner holiday dram.

The recipe is very flexible and scales down well. The image above is a half recipe split between two ~30oz bottles. In addition, I make the following modifications:

* I use fresh juice when I can. Six lemons and four oranges will cover the lemon and orange juice requirements. In addition, the lemon and orange peels go into the oleo saccharum. In a future year I will try making my own pineapple juice.
* For additional holiday flavors, I steep some caffeine-free rooibos chai in addition to or instead of the green tea.
* Cut the maraschino amount in half and replace it with allspice dram.
* I try use *Smith and Cross* navy-strength Jamaican rum for its robust flavor and funkiness.
* I go up a price bracket and use *Pierre Ferrand Ambre* instead of 1840. I find that the strong vanilla character of Ambre gives the punch a reasonable backbone.
* I have no idea where to find Batavia arrack consistently, and have had good luck substituting it with a rhum agricole.
