*De Finibus* is an exploration of evolving frontend technologies. It's written and designed by *Nicholas Husher*. The site is built in Jekyll&mdash;you can find the source code [on github], and you can subscribe to [atom xml feed] if you're into that kind of thing.

The name *De Finibus* refers to a collection of works by the Roman orator Cicero, titled *[De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum]*, or "Regarding the Ends of Good and Evil," commonly shortened to *De Finibus*. The books are a survey of the philosophical landscape in the late Roman Republic and was largely focused on how one lives a good and meaningful life. 

*Nicholas Husher* is a [code wicche] living in Boston. He works for a company called [Faraday], which is a pretty cool startup that is building a tool for machine learning-based marketing. Previously he worked for [Lola Travel Company], [Pwnie Express], and [Dealer.com]. You can find him on [twitter], [github], &amp;c.
