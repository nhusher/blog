*De Finibus* is an exploration of evolving frontend technologies. It's written and designed by *Nicholas Husher*. The site is built in Jekyll&mdash;you can find the source code [on github](https://github.com/nhusher/blog), and you can subscribe to [atom xml feed](/atom.xml) if you're into that kind of thing.

The name *De Finibus* refers to a collection of works by the Roman orator Cicero, titled *[De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_finibus_bonorum_et_malorum)*, or "Regarding the Ends of Good and Evil," commonly shortened to just *De Finibus*, or "Regarding the Ends." The books are a survey of the philosophical landscape in the late Roman Republic, which was largely focused on how one lives a good and meaningful life. 

*Nicholas Husher* is a user interface developer who lives in Burlington, VT. He's at a company called [Dealer.com](http://dealer.com), which is a pretty cool place to work. You can find him on [twitter](http://twitter.com/teslanick), [github](http://github.com/nhusher), &amp;c.
