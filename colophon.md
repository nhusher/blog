The name *De Finibus* refers to a collection of works by the Roman orator Cicero, titled *[De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum][definibus]*, or "Regarding the Ends of Good and Evil," commonly shortened to *De Finibus*. The books are a survey of the philosophical landscape in the late Roman Republic and was largely focused on how one lives a good and meaningful life.
